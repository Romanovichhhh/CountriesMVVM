# About

Hello, it's me. In this test project I tried to build android app on MVVM and clean architecture, using Dagger Hilt as DI and Apollo/GraphQl as remote datasource. This app is using the [CountriesGraphQl](https://trevorblades.github.io/countries/queries/country) backend. 

While developing, I followed official [android guide to building apps on clean arch](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture), [GraphQl documentation](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/kotlin/) and [android Hilt guide](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android). Aslo, I used some architecture components like LiveData and ViewModel.
